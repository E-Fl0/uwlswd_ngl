Newspaper Genre List dataset.

Maintained at University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.

The input-MARC directory contains the main data, a series of MARC authority records for concepts describing newspaper genres. This is encoded as MARC-XML.

The output-RDF directory contains the same data as RDF in multiple serialization: RDF/XML, HTML/RDFa, Turtle, N-Triples. This directory also contains a non-RDF version of the data: an HTML (without RDFa) version intended to be published on the UW Libraries web site.

The code directory contains code for transforming the data from format to format.
